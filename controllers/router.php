/*
This program is a router for a Web app created using the MVC pattern. 
The router parses URLs, and sends data to the appropriate controllers.
Adapted from http://johnsquibb.com/tutorials/mvc-framework-in-1-hour-part-one

Standards:
1. ALL calls to the Web app must go through this router.
2. URLs must match a standard format.
3. Your code files must be put in standard directories, so that the router 
   (this program) can find them.
4. Your code files must have standard names that match URL components.

URL sample: http://xxx.com/myapp/?fetch&id=42
This calls the fetch controller, passing it an id of 42.
 
The controller must be a class called Fetch_Controller, in a file called 
fetch.php, in the controllers directory.

This router will call the method main of the controller, and pass it 
parameters from the URL.

There are some sample files showing usage:

controllers/show.php - show some data.
models/zombie.php - model for zombies.
views/zombie.php - view for showing zombie data.
views/templates/one_zombie.php - template views/zombie.php uses to show data.

Sample url: http://xxx.com/?show&id=44&name=Dan+Lawrence
 
Calls the show controller, passes id of 44, and name of Dan Lawrence.
